Visual Studio 2022 - RDLC reports and ReportViewer in Windows Forms
Here is a step by step example:

1. Install Microsoft RDLC Report Designer 2022, and restart VS.

2. Create a new Windows Forms .NET Framework project.

3. Install the Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportViewerControl.Winforms NuGet package, which will add ReportViewer to the toolbox of your project.

Note: Optional - You may want to install Microsoft.SqlServer.Types as well to get rid of a warning which complains about version of the library.

PM> NuGet\Install-Package Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportViewerControl.Winforms -Version 150.1652.0
